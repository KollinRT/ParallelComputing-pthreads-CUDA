# What this assignment does
This assignment tasked us with working with pthreads and I also utilized CUDA in addition to this. This was after learning about both of them and working to get familiar with both.

# Next steps
Improvements would include utilizing a ThreadPool to recycle threads and then optimizing the CUDA code more as well. This would improve the runtime for both pthreads and CUDA approach.
